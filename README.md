This is a simple demonstration of R Markdown for reproducible analysis and reporting. 

It requires a few pieces of software that are all free and open-source. 

To run this code and get .html output, you will need: 

* Current version of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). 
* Current version of [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). 
* the `knitr` package. (we'll discuss how to install packages)
* the `scales` package. 

To run this and get .pdf output, you will also need some version of LaTeX. This is a big free program, and it will take some time to install: 

* Mac = install [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) (complete version). 
* Windows = install [MikTek](http://miktex.org/) (complete version).
